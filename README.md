## Inspiration
In an ever-changing tech world, women face a range of challenges at their jobs; subtle microaggressions, stereotyping, gender bias, and lack of representation. We were driven by a passion to shed light on these challenges, amplify the voices of women who have overcome them, and ultimately inspire positive change. We were also inspired by a burning desire to address the systemic gender inequalities that persist in the technology sector. That is why we created Breaking the Binary - to raise awareness and to contribute to a more inclusive and equitable future for all women pursuing careers in tech.

## What it does
Breaking the Binary is a hybrid between a visual novel and Space Invaders mini-game. The game follows the journey of a young woman entering the tech workforce and illustrates the struggles that come with it. The goal of the game is to shoot down the microaggressions that the main character faces on her first day at work, in a Space Invaders-themed mini-game.
